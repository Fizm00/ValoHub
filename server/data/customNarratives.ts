    "Ascent": "An open playground for small wars of position and attrition, Ascent features two sites separated by a wide, open center court. Each site can be defended by irreversible bomb doors; once they’re down, you’ll have to destroy them or find another way to retake the site.",
    "Bind": "Two sites. No middle. Within these sand-blown ruins, you must choose your path: attackers can strike directly or use one of two one-way teleporters to flank. Defenders must remain vigilant, as every rotation is a risky gamble.",
    "Breeze": "Take in the sights of historic ruins or seaside caves on this tropical paradise. But bring some cover. You'll need it for the wide open spaces and long range engagements. Watch your flank and this will be a breeze.",
    "Fracture": "A top secret research facility split apart by a failed radianite experiment. With defender spawn in the middle, attackers can pinch from both sides. The H-shaped layout includes ziplines running underneath the facility.",
    "Haven": "Beneath a forgotten monastery, a clamour of competing agents clash to control three sites. There’s more territory to control, but more defenders to hold it. This extra estate makes for more aggressive pushes and complex retakes.",
    "Icebox": "Your next battleground is a secret Kingdom excavation site overtaken by the arctic. The two plant sites are protected by snow and metal, requiring some horizontal finesse. Take advantage of the ziplines and they’ll never see you coming.",
    "Lotus": "A mysterious structure with an astral power radiating from ancient ruins. Doorways blow open to reveal new paths and three sites to control. Large stone doors rotate to open up opportunities, or shut them down completely.",
    "Pearl": "Attackers push down into a two-site underwater city pitch in a geo-dome. Pearl is a map without gimmicks, relying on geography and team coordination. Fight through the mid plaza or the long wings in this traditional battleground.",
    "Split": "If you want to go far, you’ll have to go up. A pair of sites split by an elevated center allows for rapid movement using two rope ascenders. Each site has a looming tower that is vital for control. Watch out above before it all blows up.",
    "Sunset": "A disaster at a local Kingdom facility threatens to engulf the whole neighborhood. Stop at your favorite food truck and fight across the city in this traditional three-lane map.",
    "Abyss": "A secret base built within a massive chasm. Verticality is key here, with many ways to fall to your death. Watch your step.",
    "Drift": "A TDM map set in a floating city."
